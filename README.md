## Description

This application uses a inquire npm package to ask the user a series of question in the terminal. Once the user answers all the question a logo will be generated through a svg file.

## Usage

The user must go through the question sequentially. The first question will ask them to input text of what they want to be on their logo. The answer must be three letters or less or another response will be required. Next the user will be prompted to choose between a circle, square and a triangle as the shape. Finally they will input the color of their choice. Once the questions are completed a svg file will be created called logo.svg which when opened will allow the user to see their logo.
